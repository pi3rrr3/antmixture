This repo contains scripts related to the preprint entitled "Rapid and repeatable genome evolution across three hybrid ant populations" available here: https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.01.16.476493 (check the paper for software versions).

The folder reads2SNPs contains scripts for trimming, mapping and deduplicating reads, and then calling, filtering and phasing variant sites. Note the script 7_SNP_calling_4pixy.sh performs variant and invariant site calling to estimate diversity & divergence metrics in 20kb windows with pixy (https://doi.org/10.1111/1755-0998.13326).

The folder local_ancestry contains scripts to perform local ancestry inference using Loter (https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msy126), topology weighting with Twisst (https://doi.org/10.1534/genetics.116.194720) and good old chromosome painting.
